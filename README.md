# SimpleMath

SimpleMath is a small C++ library for math. Currently there is only 2 and 3 dimentional vectors implemented.

## Getting Started
SimpleMath was tested only with Visual Studio 2019! You can try and use anything you want.

Clone the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/Borstch/SimpleMath`.

Generate projects by `vendor\bin\premake\premake5.exe vs2019` or just use .bat file.

### Features that I want to implement:
 - Complex numbers
 - Matrices
 - N dimentional vectors
 - Explore a faster way to do calculations
